## [1.1.0](https://github.com/cartant/tslint-etc/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0) (2018-05-06)

## Features

* Added a `no-unused-declaration` rule. It's similar to TSLint's built-in [`no-unused-variable`](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/no-unused-variable/) rule, but has a simpler implementation and fewer [problems](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/search?q=no-unused-variable&state=open&type=Issues). Hopefully.
